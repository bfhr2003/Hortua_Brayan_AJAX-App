**Welcome üì≤!,** this repo it's about an interactive web application which utilizes JavaScript to connect to various APIs and fetch essential data about earbud components. Through a 3D model viewer, users can explore the details of the earphones and access specific information by hovering over key points.

> The application dynamically establishes connections with APIs using JavaScript to import real-time data about earbud components.

> A 3D model viewer enables users to examine each earbud component from any angle, enhancing visual understanding.

> The application uses JavaScript functions to trigger contextual information when hovering over specific hotspots around the earbuds. This provides precise details about each part of the earbud.

> A template tag is implemented to display the names of materials along with detailed descriptions for each. This is achieved by connecting to a dedicated API that provides specific information about the materials used.
